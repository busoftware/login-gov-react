## Login.gov React Auth Wrapper

Inspiration for this library is derived from the [Auth0 React Library](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react).

## How to get started

1. Create a [Developer Account](https://developer.login.gov)
2. [Request access](https://login.gov/partners/business-inquiries/) by filling out your justification for using Login.gov's auth solution
3. You will meet with Login.gov team to verify need and go over costs (mentioned below)
4. Setup sandbox account by following these [Instructions]()
5. Copy the **client_id** and intended **acr_values** to use in this solution

### A few sticking points that may hold you up

1. Have a government sponsor (know someone that works for the government) that can take responsibility and knows what you're building is actually a requirement
2. Mention this person with their contact info in the justification mentioned above
3. If you are on an active contract that makes this process even easier
4. On average 1k active users ~ $60k a year. So checkbooks or line of accounting should be provided by government or your company.
